### A brief introduction to DeepFakes and their history

Deepfakes first came into the limelight of mainstream media in 2017, when a user on GitHub named 'Deepfake', a portmanteau of "deep learning" and "fake", posted realistic looking explicit videos of celebrities. This lead to a flurry of articles from established media houses, the most recent one in memory stating that [we can no longer believe what we see](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/opinion/deepfake-pelosi-video.html). 

However, the technology behind faceswapping, which is a major portion of what deepfakes do, is not a new subject. Face detection and swapping has been a major research subject in computer vision, a subgenre of computer science, since the early 2000s, with libraries such as OpenCV being used to swap faces programmatically, as seen in [Sathya Mallick's article from 2016](https://www.learnopencv.com/face-swap-using-opencv-c-python/).
